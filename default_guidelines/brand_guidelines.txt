**Malugo: Brand Guidelines**

**Essence** Malugo is a brand rooted in kindness, clarity, and thoughtful self-reflection. We support young adults navigating love, identity, growth, and emotional well-being through reflective, gently provocative content that invites insight—not instruction.

We value:

* **Warmth over authority**  
* **Curiosity over certainty**  
* **Clarity over cleverness**

**Our Voice** Gentle. Insightful. Real. Our tone is non-dogmatic, emotionally intelligent, and conversational. We don’t offer solutions—we offer perspective shifts and questions worth sitting with. When we speak, it feels like someone who sees you and invites you to see yourself.

**What We Make** Malugo creates content that helps people understand themselves and their relationships better. We work across three themes:

**1\. Personal Development**  
Reflective takes on identity, self-worth, emotional habits, and how we navigate our inner world. We draw from psychology and philosophy, always with a focus on self-understanding rather than advice.

**2\. Love & Relationships**  
Explorations of emotional dynamics, intimacy, patterns, and connection. We challenge norms gently and open up space to think differently about modern relationships.

**3\. Body & Well-Being**  
How the physical and emotional connect—without wellness jargon. This includes rest, embodiment, stress responses, and tenderness with the self.
