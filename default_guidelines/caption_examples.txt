Content idea: The effect of trauma on the body

Caption with hashtags: 
When we carry trauma in the body, we spend most of our time in defensive mode. Avoiding the racing thoughts and uncomfortable sensations in the body. To heal, we have to practice pausing, breathing, and responding. Making new choices every single day. Asking: ‚Äúwhat would the healthiest version of me do now?‚Äù And of course forgiving ourselves over and over again when we do fall back into our familiar patterns that once kept us safe #selfhealers

Content idea: Situationship fatigue

Caption with hashtags: 
Why can situationships be so damn stressful?! It‚Äôs not you...it‚Äôs the ambiguity that your mind is trying to make sense of. 

Without clear containers, we might become hypervigilant to any sign or signal that a relationship is either escalating or deescalating.  Because we often misinterpret these signals, we might also find ourselves completely missing the intentions of another person.

Containers aren‚Äôt the same things as labels (although for some people, labels can help with the creation of containers). If labels feel confining, you can still create containers through tools like The Relationship Anarchy Smorgasbord that promote expansiveness.

What has been the most exhausting part of situationships for you?

Content idea: How to navigate ghosting when dating

Caption with hashtags:
It can be hard to resist the temptation to send those texts trying to figure out what went wrong, especially in situations where you‚Äôve been intimate.

Getting ghosted can hurt, a lot. But you deserve someone who can directly communicate with you, even if it‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre not what they‚Äôre looking for.

Have you ever been ghosted? Have you been the ghost? üëª

Content idea: Red flags versus triggers

Caption with hashtags:
One of the most helpful things you can do for yourself when it comes to trying to understand the line between a red flag and a trigger, is to clarify what your values and boundaries are.

When your nervous system is calm, take some time to think about what traits your ideal partner would have and how you want them to make you feel.

That way, the next time you find yourself activated, you have a clearer idea of whether or not the experiences of your past are being brought into the present moment or if this person just doesn‚Äôt align with your values.

You are not at fault for your childhood wounds. But you are responsible for healing them so you can live a life that is free of the patterns of the past. ‚Å†

This week we brought licensed marriage and family therapist Vienna Pharaon onto the podcast to dive into the deep-rooted wounds that can cause us to repeatedly self-sabotage and engage in unhealthy patterns with those we love (even when we swear we know better).
