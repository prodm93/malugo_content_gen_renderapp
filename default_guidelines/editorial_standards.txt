*Editorial Principles**

* **Reflective, Not Prescriptive**: We don’t tell people what to do. We help them notice their own patterns and ask better questions.  
* **Simple, Not Simplistic**: We express complex ideas in a clear, human way. Our language is accessible but never watered down.  
* **Inclusive Without Tokenism**: We write with awareness that identity, history, and social context shape experience. We challenge norms without assuming everyone has the same story.  
* **Depth Before Detail**: Facts support our work, but insight leads it. We prefer one sharp idea to a list of tips.

**Mental Health Note** We are not a clinical source. When touching on sensitive topics, we avoid pathologising, avoid diagnosis language, and always centre human experience. If relevant, we gently point toward professional support.

**Content Tone Checklist**

**Things We Avoid**

* Clinical or diagnostic labels (unless explicitly contextualised)  
* Buzzwords like "empowerment," "powerful," "unstoppable"  
* Cliches about healing, wholeness, or self-love  
* Over-explaining. We trust our readers' intelligence.

**In a Line**  
Malugo helps people see themselves more clearly—without judgement, without noise, and without pretending there are easy answers.
